Delivery & Pickup Options - 43 reviews of Wing Shack - West Greeley "Great Food, great location on west Greeley, excellent selection of beer. The burgers and corn dogs are very good too. If I could change something I would add table service instead of ordering at counter, and I would add something to absorb sound, it can be very loud. But food quality makes up for any /5(43). Established in Our 8th regional location, Wing Shack 10th Street is proud to serve central Greeley with the region's finest chicken wings. 12 sauces. 4 dry Cuisine: Chicken Wings.  · Greeley has two Wing Shacks- one on the southeast side and one in the far west. I have generally always liked my Wing Shack experience. Today my husband ordered a side salad (I don't ordered salad until I see someone else's) and it looked great.4/5(49).
