  Sorta OT, snowblower impeller mod Collapse If clamped tightly the shaft and auger sleeve effectively become one piece. To prevent this type of jam, slow down so snow blower only takes in as much snow as the impeller can move to the chute. Don't use a snow blower on wet, slushy. Did it to my 20yr/old 7hp 2-stage, 24" Yardman snowblower. This model has a small 3-bladed impeller. I used scraps from the rubber auger off.
  
   · Honda Toro Ariens Simplicity Troy-Bilt Cub Cadet John Deere  STUFF YOU NEED TO DO THIS IS LINKED BELOWKeep the snow from sticking to the chute and aug.  · this is how i do it for ariens snowblowers. i use toro s paddles. i remove the chute. measure the impeller blades and cut them to size using an angle grinder. i then cut a piece of sheet aluminum or sheet steel slightly smaller them the piece of rubber i cut out. then i take the rubber and sheet metal and lay it on the the impeller blade . · Snowblower hack. Home This happens when there is a gap between the edge of the impeller (the device that pushes the snow through the chute) and the side of the chute. My gap was just under a 1/2″. By adding a rubber pad on each impeller blade, the gap goes away and so does any build-up. Can’t wait to test this on the first snows.
